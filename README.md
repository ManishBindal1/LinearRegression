## General Information
- This is a programming assignment part of a course. 
- Build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.
- Identify the features affecting the demand for shared bikes.

## Conclusions
Some inferences based on the fact that if all the independent variables are kept constant except one
- 24% increase in count in 2019
- 41% increase in count with increase (by one unit) in temperature felt by users
- 14% decrease in count with increase in windspeed (by one unit)
- 11% decrease in count in spring season
- 6% increase in count in winter season

## Technologies Used
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKLearn, StatsModels
